"GREEN vs RED" - Mentor Mate Devcamp Assignment

START UP CLASS:
The static StartUp class contains all the static variables which the application needs to read and pass the user`s input.
There is also a separate method for reading and checking the user input - ReadInput(). The ReadInput() method reads,
and converts the input and also uses an intance of the InputValidator class. The method passes all the arguments to 
the validator class for checking. After the input is checked the Main() method creates an instances of the AdjacencyMatrix
class and the Engine class. Then it initialize all the input from the static variables to the matrix and the Engine.Start() method
for receiving the result and printing it to the console as required.
